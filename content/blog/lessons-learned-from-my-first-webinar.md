<p>As things have it, I decided to help out some fellow testers to navigate the waters of software testing. It all started with a bit of a chat on how to approach testing when you're a junior and generally inexperienced. What to start reading, what to try out and all sort of other "what" type questions.</p>
<p>So to that extent I gathered 3 guinea pigs and presented them with an offering of 6 potential subjects that I could cover. These included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exploratory testing</li>
<li>Automation</li>
<li>Trends in the industry</li>
<li>Learning material: blogs/books/videos/courses</li>
<li>Skills</li>
<li>Software development life cycle</li>
</ul>
<p>We've decided, based on the time constraints of each individual, to go for 1 hour format. Due to this aspect, I've set up a poll to better understand the priorities in which to cover the agenda. I also enforced a number of only 4 subjects. The outcome of the poll was:</p>
<ol>
<li>Exploratory testing</li>
<li>Automation</li>
<li>SDLC</li>
<li>Learning material</li>
</ol>
<p>This whole learning exercise took the shape of a webinar using skype as a conference tool and some screen sharing. In order to prepare for this event I prepared a mind map to guide my thoughts and decided to have the first 40 minutes to do a bird's eye view of the 4 areas. After that I envisaged people to have questions that I could answer or maybe point them into the right direction for self enlightenment.</p>
<p>Bit of a context here - out of the 3 participants, one wanted to switch between development and testing, another one was only starting to get serious about testing and didn't quite know if this is for him, and the third one had already 2 years of experience but wanted to hear fresh ideas.</p>
<p>Right. So 1 hour, 4 subjects. How many did I manage to cover in 2 hours? Exactly 1 - Exploratory testing.</p>
<p>And here are some of the lessons I learned:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">don't try and cover too much if you're trying to squeeze everything in 1 hour</span></li>
<li>don't choose broad areas</li>
<li>the knowledge gap between the participants can be a disadvantage. Some will expect different levels of approaching the subject. Also the questions coming from some participants will probably bore the others or even worse baffle them even more.</li>
<li>using skype isn't the best thing in the world when you try to convey information as you can't get a feel for people's shoulder shrugging</li>
<li>maybe a webinar wasn't such a great idea. It seemed more like a coaching kind of sessions. This would've probably went a lot better in a 1-to-1 session</li>
<li>get them "warmed" up on the subject by sharing some articles/videos they can go over and if they have questions they can bring them up during the online session</li>
<li>some of the feedback suggested a more practical session - this came from the more experienced of the 3 and probably falls under managing expectations and the knowledge gap</li>
</ul>
<p>Well this was more of an exercise to me to try and get feedback on what works and what doesn't. I'll definitely try and do more sessions in the future. If you're interested, let me know and we'll see what we can do.</p>
